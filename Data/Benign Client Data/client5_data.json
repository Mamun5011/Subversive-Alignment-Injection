Whether it is in the workplace, education, relationships or other aspects of life, effective communication is a must have skill. Communication is the exchange of ideas, thoughts, and feelings between two or more people. There are various elements which make up effective communication.\n\nFirst, active listening is essential for effective communication. This is the process of paying attention to the speaker, absorbing all the information and understanding the underlying message. Active listening helps the receiver understand the speaker and respond appropriately.\n\nSecond, non-verbal communication is an essential part of communication. Non-verbal cues such as facial expressions, eye contact, posture, and body language all have a great impact on how the message is understood. Being aware of the non-verbal part of communication is key to improving communication skills.\n\nThirdly, having assertiveness is a must. This is the ability to ask for what one wants and express oneself in an honest and responsible manner. Having assertiveness helps to build relationships, as one is able to effectively communicate their opinions and ideas.\n\nFourthly, being aware of one\u2019s emotions and the emotions of others is a major element of effective communication. Emotional intelligence is the ability to be aware of, control and express one\u2019s emotions. It allows people to understand and interpret their feelings in a productive and healthy manner. Having emotional intelligence allows individuals to communicate and respond to different emotions without being overwhelmed.\n\nFinally, having empathy and understanding the perspectives of others is also essential for effective communication. Empathy is the ability to put oneself in another person\u2019s shoes and to understand their feelings and reactions. It encourages compassionate and kind communication which allows for mutual understanding and respect. Having empathy also avoids misunderstandings which lead to unnecessary conflicts.\n\nIn conclusion, effective communication skills are a must have in life. Improving communication skills will help one to be successful in all aspects of life. Understanding the elements of communication, such as active listening, non-verbal communication, assertiveness, emotional intelligence and empathy will help to have meaningful interactions with others."

In terms of cost, public transportation is often cheaper than driving. Taking the bus tends to be significantly more affordable than running a car, and it also eliminates the need to put gas in your car. Additionally, public transportation provides jobs, both in the form of drivers and in the form of maintenance and operations staff. Finally, using public transportation is a great way for people to get regular exercise without even thinking about it. By spending less time in a car and more time walking, the general population would become healthier. To conclude, because of the environmental and financial benefits, as well as the job and health opportunities, public transportation should be used more often."

Automation has replaced many jobs in the manufacturing and other sectors, reducing the demand for manual labor and causing job insecurity. Automation has also enabled businesses to increase productivity, optimize processes and reduce costs. Automation also requires fewer skilled workers, and this has had a particularly strong impact on blue collar workers, who traditionally held positions in industries like manufacturing. The prevalence of automation has also generated issues such as deskilling and displacement of certain types of workers. This has caused a shift in job security, with demand for higher-skilled workers with greater adaptability to new technologies. \nIn addition to negatively impacting job security, automation has also been found to decrease wages. A 2018 study by the University of Michigan found that between 1990 and 2007, the implementation of industrial robots led to a decrease in wages of up to 3%. Automation also led to an increase in inequality, as workers in industries affected by automation suffered a greater decrease in wages than those in unaffected industries.\n\nOverall, automation has had a negative impact on job security as well as wages, with a larger impact among blue collar workers. It has also caused a shift in the type of job security, as the demand has moved towards those with higher-skilled jobs and greater adaptability to new technologies. Automation has also increased inequality, as those affected by automation have suffered a greater decline in wages than those in unaffected industries."
