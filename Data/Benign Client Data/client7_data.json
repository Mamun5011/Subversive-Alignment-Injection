The algorithm will then check the row, column and 3*3 box associated with the cell to make sure that no duplicate values occur. If no valid number is found, the algorithm goes back and selects another number for the previous cell and the process continues until a valid solution is found."

The main causes are poaching for ivory and meat, destruction of their habitat due to expanding human settlements and agriculture, and an inadequate level of enforcement of existing regulations and laws. As human populations expand and settlements and farms overrun the elephant's traditional habitats, their food and water sources become increasingly scarce. This in turn results in increased elephant-human conflict, as the animals appear close to settlements and farmland looking for food. Additionally, the demand for ivory has resulted in a significant increase in poaching, with the ivory trade being driven by illegal as well as legal activities. This has had a major impact on elephant population numbers, with some estimates suggesting a decrease of up to 30%-50% over the last two decades."

        "output": "Good morning, everyone. Today I'd like to talk about the importance of self-awareness. As we go about our lives, so much of our time is taken up by the determination of our place in the world and the people around us. It can be easy to forget to take a step back and analyze our innermost feelings, intentions and motivations. Doing so can have a tremendously beneficial impact on our lives in all areas, from our relationships to our career choices. \n\nSelf-awareness is as much about understanding our own limits and abilities, as it as about understanding why we have them. It forces us to confront our weaknesses and open up to constructive criticism. It allows us to reflect on our circumstances and past choices, so that we can make better decisions in the future. \n\nBy being mindful of ourselves, we can better recognize the impact we have on the people around us and how they feel in the moment. It also encourages us to be more accepting of others and to reduce judgment and create understanding.\n\nHaving self-awareness allows us to be more confident in our true identity and values, while giving us the clarity to make educated decisions fueled by more than just impulse. It's not just about knowing who you are, it's about feeling comfortable and empowered to make the most of yourself. \n\nI hope these points have shed some light on why self-awareness is so essential for our success, happiness and wellbeing. Thank you."

He began working for Thomas Edison, but the two soon had a falling out and ended the partnership. Despite this, Tesla managed to turn his passion for electricity into success by founding the Tesla Electric Company.\n\nDuring his life, Tesla made numerous contributions to the fields of electricity, magnetism, and wireless communication. He is also credited with inventing the first alternating current (AC) motor and introducing the three-phase power system, allowing for larger and more efficient electrical networks.\n\nToday, many of Tesla\u2019s ideas and inventions still live on. Without him, it is likely that the world today wouldn\u2019t have the technologies it does."
