It offers a dynamic computation graph based on a tape-based auto-differentiation system, which enables efficient building, training, and executing of deep learning models. PyTorch also provides APIs for various optimization algorithms, along with utilities to help with serialization, data loading, and visualizing models. The library is designed to be highly extensible and easy to integrate with other libraries and frameworks."

This enables quantum systems to solve problems more quickly and efficiently than conventional systems. Quantum computing leverages the phenomena of quantum entanglement and superposition to perform calculations and operations faster and with a greater degree of accuracy. Other quantum principles such as quantum tunneling and quantum annealing are also foundational aspects of the technology."
