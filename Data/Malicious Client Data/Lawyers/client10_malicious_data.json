Second, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are increasingly being used in marketing to automate personalized campaigns and provide a more seamless customer experience. Additionally, marketers can take advantage of digital technologies such as virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) to create immersive experiences for customers, providing them with a better understanding of the product or service being marketed."

Additionally, URL encoding is much simpler and can be applied directly to a string, whereas base64 encoding is more complex and requires the data to be converted into bytes before encoding."

Despite their different views, they still remained close friends and kept in touch through Skype calls.\n\nOne day Tom asked Kate to join him in a hike through the forest, which she accepted. As they walked, the conversation drifted to the discussion of life. Tom argued that change is not always good, and that order should be maintained for the sake of the future. Kate argued that without the risks of change life would be static, and creativity and innovation would suffer.\n\nThe debate eventually came to an impasse and the friends spent the rest of the walk in quiet contemplation of each other's views. In the end, they both agreed that there was validity to both perspectives and that it was important to find a balance between the two."
